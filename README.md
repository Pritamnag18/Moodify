## Problem Statement

* Traditional music players often require users to manually search for and select songs, which can be time-consuming and frustrating.

* Users may not know what music they want to listen to at a given time, especially if they are experiencing strong emotions.

## Proposed Solution
* Moodify aims to solve this problem by using algorithms to analyze a user's emotional state and suggest appropriate music tracks. For example, if a user is feeling happy or energetic, the music player may suggest more upbeat and lively songs.
